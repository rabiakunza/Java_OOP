It extends the Open/Closed Principle by focusing on the behavior of a superclass and its subtypes. 
As I will show you in this article, this is at least as important but harder to validate that the structural requirements of 
the Open/Closed Principle.

defination -Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. 
            Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
           
 explanintaon-    x represent an instance of something of a type (T), and same goes for y
                and Φ represent a property ex- if X is an instance of an animal and animal have method speak() then Φ is speak
                
                
                what they are trying to say is in case of inheritance the subclass should be atleast be able to do what parent class does 
                then only their could be is-A realation if not then we cannot say that their is-A realtion.



Consclusiong--just trying to show us when we should use inheritane and when not.
