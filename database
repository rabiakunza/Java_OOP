Current Systems
RDBMS

two flavours of RDBMS are  Resporting system(OLAP) or Operational system(OLTP)

1)Reporting System
-OLAP(online analytical processing)
    Reporting system are designed and optimized to read data result out often aggrigated or summerized data out

2)Operationl System
-OLTP(online Transactonal processing)
    Operational system are designed to take in new data (Insert update and delete).
    
    
Key aspect of these system are
3)defined by schema on write (when you insert/update/delete certain rules like length,type etc. are verified)
4)RDBMS are queried via T-SQL language
5)OLTP schema - normalized table, joins         ex-customer , order 



NoSQL database
-----------------
characterstics
1)non realtional(no sturcture of smei) 
2)high sclability(sharding and partition automatically)
3)often focus on high availibilty, scalablity, and eventual consistency.

Cardinality-1:1, 1:N, N:1 or N:N realation ship
you need to characterize your “One-to-N” relationship with a bit more nuance: is it “one-to-few”, “one-to-many”, or 
“one-to-squillions”? Depending on which one it is, you’d use a different format to model the relationship.
