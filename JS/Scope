SCOPE

ex-1
var name="vinay"

if(name==="vinay")
{
var department="engg";
}

console.log(name);//vinay
console.log(department);//engg

Note:value of departement is present outside the block, As js does not create scope for blocks, js is function scope but new feature
allow us to define block scope.


ES6 feature:In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope,
            which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.
            
            
Ex-2
var top=10;
var inner=50;
function foo(){
  var inner=20;
  console.log(inner);
}

foo();//20
console.log(inner)//50;
