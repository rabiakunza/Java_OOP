Prototype in JS
-----------------
js is a protyping language and inheritance is based on prototype.
in order to learn prototype you need to learn how consturctor work, how inheritance work in JS.


By default every function has a property called prototype.
by default this property is empty and you can add property and methods to it.
when you create objects from this a function(X) then it will inherit method and property thats defined in X as a prototype.
