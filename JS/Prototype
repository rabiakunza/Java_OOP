Prototype in JS
-----------------
js is a protyping language and inheritance is based on prototype.
in order to learn prototype you need to learn how consturctor work and how inheritance work in JS.


PROTOTYPE
By default every function has a property called prototype.
by default this property is empty and you can add property and methods to it.
when you create objects from this a function(X) then it will inherit method and property thats defined in X as a prototype.

CONSTRUCTOR
JS has no class implementation
JS has prototype based inheritance
just like in java we create class and create object from it.
in JS you would creat constuctor and using this constuctor you can create objects form it.

Every function expression is a constructor in JS

ex-1
function test(){
}

So its equivalent to 
Var test=new Function();//build in constructor Function()


ex-2
var x=Function(j){
this.i=0;
this.j=j;

this.getJ=Function(){
    return this.j;
  };
};

so this is an example of a constructor and now i can make instances of x using keywork new
var x1=new x(1);
var x2=new x(2);
