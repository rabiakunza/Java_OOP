**The CAP theorem** (also called Brewerâ€™s theorem) 
states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three 
characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.


Consistency
A system is said to be consistent if all nodes see the same data at the same time.
Simply, if we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation.
This means that, the read should cause all nodes to return the same data, i.e., the value of the most recent write.
