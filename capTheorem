**The CAP theorem** (also called Brewerâ€™s theorem) 
states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three 
characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.


**Consistency**
A system is said to be consistent if all nodes see the same data at the same time.
Simply, if we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation.
This means that, the read should cause all nodes to return the same data, i.e., the value of the most recent write.

**Availability**
Availability in a distributed system ensures that the system remains operational 100% of the time. Every request gets 
a (non-error) response regardless of the individual state of a node.
or 
everyone can read form or write to a database.
Note: this does not guarantee that the response contains the most recent write.

Note: Relational database can be Partition horizontally or vetically, Nosql database are Partition horizontally.

**Partition**
works when data is divided
or
This condition states that the system does not fail, regardless of if messages are dropped or delayed between nodes in a system.
Partition tolerance has become more of a necessity than an option in distributed systems. It is made possible by sufficiently 
replicating records across combinations of nodes and networks.



You can have 
1)CA
2)AP
2)PC

Realational database tends towards consistency and availablilty.Partition handling is something that relatonal database does not handel
well.often you have to write custome code to handle partition.

NoSQL- tends towards partition tollerance.data is always avaliable to read from and write to and you are able to
add partition as your nodes grow

ex-consistency may not be important ex- you may load comment section after a while or show changes after some time.
