It's better to have many small interfaces rather than a few large interfaces.
or too many is better then too few.


What is the benefit of doing interface segregatoin?
-by creating small interfaces and seperating diffrent roles and responsibility we are favouring composition over inheritence
  and we are favouring decoupling over coupling. 
-it's like mircoservices ,we divide the  responsiblity and composing them together the way we want.
