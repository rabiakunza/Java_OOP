O — Open/Closed Principle
This principle suggests that “classes/method/packages should be open for extension but closed for modification”. 
What is means is that if the class A is written by the developer AA, and if the developer BB wants some modification on 
that then developer BB should be easily do that by extending class A, but not by modifying class A.

ex-function that can itterate on every type of object follow open close principle
